*      created
*      8/27/90 -PaulC  [part of general MDOS cleanup]
*
* page equates for MDOS ... intentionally volatile, to break
* non-standard code with each release of MDOS
*
* 1.18.2021 added P_TIPI after HFDC code page
*
* 7.29.2022 Updated PAGE mapping for file compression. If this file
*           changes page listing, then CYA\PATCH_S must be changed as well for
*           pages P_HFC1, P_HFC2, and P_SCSI

* I will be increasing MDOS by 8k, by transferring this page to PLAST+2,
* saving the image, and then when MDOS loads, direct MDOS to copy the
* page to page # >12
