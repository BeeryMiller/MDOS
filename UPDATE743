                    Updates by T. Tesch (InsaneMultitasker)
                            &  B. Miller (9640News)

                      CRC CHECK >98A5 FOR ORIGINAL RELEASE

==============================================================================
* Release 7.43

          OS Corrections:

               - This update has a single fix to address a single issue with
          the Myarc HFDC when used as a single floppy disk controller.  This
          fixes the Format routine.

          Other files from the V7.40 and V7.42 have been included in this
          distribution.


* Release 7.42

          OS Corrections:

               - The SCSI powerup routine was not clearing the common
          buffer used by SCSI/Horizon/IDE whenever a SCSI card was not in
          the system. The most common problem was intermittent access to
          the Horizon hard drive partitions; the drive parameter table was
          invalid, since it contained values set 'randomly' when the
          system was turned on.  The powerup logic has been corrected and
          tested.

               - SCSI routines now check for the presence of the SCSI
          card. The OS no longer locks up if you inadvertently try to
          access a non-existent SCSI device.

               - Floppy controller powerup was testing for the presence of
          a card, however, the flag was reset if a TIPI was in the system.
          Fixed the powerup routine and then added a test to the low-level
          code. OS no longer executes the floppy code when there is no FDC
          present.

               - Floppy format code has been tested with above correction;
          attempting to format a non-existent FDC now reports an error.

               - Removed old SCSI code and labels.  Cleaned up some of the
          statements.  Removed comments that were no longer relevant or
          accurate.

               - Change Directory command now validates whether the
          directory exists.

               - Fixed VDP header setup in /4A mode - SAVE file issues

               - SAVE file issues have been fixed to the the extent
          that an incomplete file can now be deleted and is reported
          as the proper type.  Further research is needed to review DSR
          error traps and boundary conditions.

          Note: ABASIC may lock some files after an error condition; a
          soft reset will clear the file lock.

               - VIDEO command repaired.

               - TELNET command has been enhanced and updated.
          enhanced and updated.

               - ANSI Driver has been updated to v1.03.  Corrections and
          improvements.

          Informational:

                - The TIPI SAVE and LOAD opcodes are limited
          to 64K by the TIPI; this may be resolved in the future by
          utilizing BREAD/BWRITE to bypass the TIPI /4A-induced
          limitation.

                -Source code folder and file structure preparation for
          Github repository. Binary, object file separation.



CYA V7.42 is included with this distribution file. Functionality remains the
same, however some code has been removed to prepare for the release of the
source code on GITHUB. Look to www.9640News.com for links when the code is
released.


===============================================================================

MDOS 7.40 is a significant update from MDOS 7.30 with significant updates to
the TIPI, IDE, and SCSI code. If you are using a TIPI, you absolutely MUST
update to the new TIPI image V3.16 or greater. TIPI Versins 3.11 or earlier
will result in file corruption if you use the MDOS COPY command at the MDOS
prompt.  Disk managers such as Clint Pulley's Directory Manager or Fred Kaal's
GDM2K have no issue.  Simply put, the last sector of any file copied with the
MDOS COPY command using TIPI V3.11 will result in the last sector of the file
being corrputed.  The file will show it properly copied, but it did not!!!
This does not pertain to any other disk storage device except for the TIPI.

CYA Version 7.40 is being released with this release of MDOS.  Barring any
future updates, Version 7.40 should be self-aware to find all necessary
addresses within MDOS.

TSTAT is being released as a standalone program.  This utility, if you are a
TIPI user, can be placed in your AUTOEXEC file.  It will alert you if a new
release of the TIPI software is available.

TIPI users should be able to remove all floppy controller cards from their
PEBox and be able to use the TIPI at CRU >1100 to boot from the TIPI drive.
DSK1 through DSK4 will be automatically configured to your settings on the
TIPI drive.

PFM USERS SHOULD NOT UPDATE THEIR PFM WITH THE CURRENT PFM OR PFM+ EPROM IF
UPDATING FROM MDOS 6.50 OR EARLIER.

A NEW UPDATE IS NEEDED WITH A NEW PFM CORE THAT IS SUPPLIED IN THE PFM
SUBDIRECTORY OF THIS ZIP FILE. THIS IS NEEDED AS MDOS IS LARGER SINCE V7.30
AND THE PFM WOULD ONLY PROGRAM A PORTION OF MDOS.

PFM USERS WISHING TO TEST THIS VERSION OF MDOS SHOULD COPY SYSTEM-SYS TO THE
ROOT DIRECTORY OF THEIR DEVICE AND USE THE HFDC, SCSI, OR RAMDISK MENU OPTIONS
TO LOAD AND DO NOT REPROGRAM THE PFM. THIS CAUTION IS ONLY FOR PFM USERS!!!!!


It is highly encouraged to pursue at minimum a Raspberry PI (3B, 4, or greater)
along with a TIPI available from ArcadeShopper.com.  This will give you near
hard drive like speed comparable with the Myarc HFDC if you do not have one
already.

In addition, with other utilities like GDM2K, you can backup any device to the
TIPI.  Using a network share, one can then further backup the files on the PI
to another computer for additional protection.

Eprom updates will be required for your Geneve if you desire to boot from TIPI
or IDE.

It should be noted that if you are intending on using a TIPI, if you purchased
one after late 2020, the CPLD should be running the latest code.  If not, it
needs to be reprogrammed. Contact ArcadeShopper on Atariage for information.
Without the CPLD update, the TIPI works fine on the TI-99/4A but will not work
on the Geneve.

MDOS has been tested with PI version 3.15, and the most current DSR Build of
2021-02-24. The DSR build is less relavent unless you are using Rompage in GPL
mode as MDOS has been coded with the TIPI DSR.  Critical is making sure you
are updated to the PI version code of 3.15 or greater. Several fixes were
made to the underlying code written by Matt addressing some file handling
concerns within the Python code on the PI.

T. Tesch has available a utility for the PFM that will allow reprogramming a
PFM or PFM+ to support the larger MDOS file.  This will no longer require
splitting MDOS into multiple files.

MDOS size overall has increased from 128K to 136K to accomodate the extra TIPI
code.  All Geneves need to have at minimum a 32K memory upgrade that has been a
requirement since MDOS 5.00.

If you have received this file, and wonder how you are going to get the files
to your Geneve, you have several options.

1) ArcadeShopper has permission to distribute MDOS on floppies.
2) Download and extract/copy files in TIFILES format to the TIPI.
       a) Once files are extracted, use DM2K with Editor/Assembler in
          ROMPAGE mode, and copy files to a storage device such as WDS1
          (Myarc HFDC device name in ROMPAGE mode), SCSI drives, or
          to floppy drive if your floppy drives work in Rompage mode.
3) Copy files with TIIMAGETOOL or TIDIR and transfer to DSK images to use
   with a floppy emulator.
4) Transfer files through a terminal emulator from one PC to another.
5) There are other means besides these one may have established.


PFM+, PFM512 and MDOS
---------------------
       There is separate software that permits updating MDOS onto any PFM or
       PFM+ device without the need to split the file. Those notes will be
       detailed in the documentation for the PFM.


NEW GENEVE BOOT EPROM INTRODUCED FOR V7.30 AND LATER
----------------------------------------------------
       A new boot Eprom is available that will boot MDOS from the TIPI
       and other devices.  The eprom is included with this zip file or you can
       contact Bob Carmany on AtariAge for the eprom.


ATARIAGE VIA THE INTERNET
-------------------------------
       Those of you using the internet should join Atariage. This is a very
       good way to get information about the TI and Geneve computers and
       will put you in touch with quite a few of the folks still in our small
       but lively community.


9640News Website
----------------
       I have created a website for the Geneve 9640 at https://www.9640News.com
       that is accessible by everyone.  The website offers the latest program
       images files and sources for MDOS, Advanced Basic, PSystem, GPL, Forth,
       MyWord, Geneve Boot Eprom, and more. A few github repositories are
       currently listed as private as we need to update sources first.


NEW/UPDATED/REMOVED COMMANDS/ROUTINES INTRODUCED WITH VERSION 7.40
------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support to the MDOS TYPE and TELNET commands at the MDOS prompt.  Users
can optionally install the ANSI driver into their AUTOEXEC file. This will allow
ANSI displays in either text mode or 16 color graphics mode in 80 column.
Usage of the commands is described as below.

1. MDOS "TELNET" command

       Usage:

       At MDOS prompt, type:

       TELNET thekeep.net,9918 /T      connects and displays ANSI Text
       TELNET thekeep.net,9918 /G      connects and displays ANSI Graphics
       TELNET thekeep.net,9918         connects and displays text mode only


2. MDOS "TYPE" command

       TYPE <filename> /T             displays ANSI text file in Text mode
       TYPE <filename> /G             displays ANSI text file in Graphics mode
       TYPE <filename>                displays text file

NEW/UPDATED/REMOVED COMMANDS/ROUTINES INTRODUCED WITH VERSION 7.30
------------------------------------------------------------------

         IBMGRF
         ------
         The IBMGRF command now has a default of ON to define all characters
         from >00 to >FF or characters 0 to 255.

         ECHO
         ----
         By default, the ECHO command is now ECHO OFF.  This will result in the
         AUTOEXEC file not showing commands that are being executed. If you want
         to see the commands, then add an ECHO ON statement at the beginning of
         your AUTOEXEC file.  This was done to clean the display up when booting

         DISKCOPY and DISKCOMPARE
         ------------------------
         The DISKCOPY and DISKCOMP commands from the MDOS prompt have been
         removed as of Version 7.3 MDOS. These commands were infrequently if
         ever used, and space was needed needed for the updates to MDOS to
         support the TIPI and other new commands.

         TELNET
         ------
         A new command has been added to MDOS to support a localhost connection
         to the TIPI. This command also has the capability to connect to other
         telnet accessible servers. This command is only useable if you have a
         TIPI.

         To use the TELNET command, use as follows:

         TELNET localhost:23             (this connects to TIPI localhost)
         TELNET heatwave.ddns.net:9640   (this connects to the HEATWAVE BBS)
         TELNET thekeep.net:9918         (connects to The Keep BBS)
         TELNET fusionbbs.ddns.net:9640  (this connects to the FUSION BBS)
         TELNET mytbox99.ddns.net:61643  (this connects to MyTBOX99)

         To terminate a connection, press the <ESC> or <F9> keys to return back
         to the MDOS prompt.

         TIMODE2
         -------
         Replacement for TIMODE freeing up the dedicated 64K ram for MyWord.
         If you will be using MyWord, then you need to use the TIMODE command
         instead of TIMODE2 in your AUTOEXEC file.

         SCSMAP
         ------
         The SCSMAP command allows the use of SCS1 through SCS6 for devices.

         SCSMAP also allows mapping the IDE drives to a SCS device name as

         SCSMAP <x><y>

         where x=1 to 6 for SCS1 to SCS6, and y=1 to 9 for SCSI connected
         devices 1 through 9.

         To separate the IDE class of drives, the IDE drives have been set as
         y=A to H where A=IDE1, B=IDE2, C=IDE3, D=IDE4, E=IDE5, F=IDE6,
         G=IDE7, and H=IDE8. Please note that if you have partitioned your IDE
         drive to 8 partitions, our testing has indicated the 8th partition is
         presently not useable. We suspect this is a eprom programming issue
         that needs to be resolved.  The IDE card needs to be running the DSR
         from Fred Kaal at www.ti99-geek.nl, Version 14.

         The SCSMAP also allows mapping 16-bit Horizon Ramdisks into the
         SCSx "RamHardDrive" addressing.  See identifiers below.

         Please note, SCSI and IDE have more devices than the SCSMAP will
         presently allow.  Plan drive size and mapping accordingly to maximize
         your equipment configuration.

         SCSMAP <Drive><Device>

         By default, here are the default drive mappings:

         SCSMAP 11   SCSI Device #1 to SCS1.
         SCSMAP 22   SCSI Device #2 to SCS2.
         SCSMAP 33   SCSI Device #3 to SCS3.
         SCSMAP 48   HRD Ramdrive CRU >1400 to SCS4.
         SCSMAP 59   HRD Ramdrive CRU >1600 to SCS5.
         SCSMAP 6A   IDE 1st Drive, 1st Partition to SCS6.


         As an example, SCSx. may be reconfigured as follows:

         SCSMAP 12       This maps SCSI device #2 to SCS1
         SCSMAP 26       This maps SCSI device #6 to SCS2

         In addition, IDE drives and the Horizon Ramdisk when configured as a
         Ram Harddrive are also mapped as a SCSI device as follows:

         SCSMAP 48       This maps a Horizon Ramdisk at CRU >1400 to SCS4.
         SCSMAP 39       This maps a Horizon Ramdisk at CRU >1600 to SCS3.
         SCSMAP 37       This maps IDE  Device #1 to SCS3 (special case mapping)
         SCSMAP 11       This maps SCSI Device #1 to SCS1.
         SCSMAP 1A       This maps IDE  Device #1 to SCS1.
         SCSMAP 6H       This maps IDE  Device #8(H) to SCS6.

         E                IDE  Device #5
         F                IDE  Device #6
         G                IDE  Device #7
         H                IDE  Device #8

         It should be noted that Drive Assignment Device "7" is also duplicated
         as Drive Assignement Device "A".

         As of 3 April 2021, testing of the IDE support in MAME has shown a
         potential issue of being unable to use IDE Device #8 if a user has
         partitioned both drives into 4 partitions each. This is unrelated to
         MDOS as it has been confirmed in the TI-99/4A emulation as well within
         MAME. The developer of the DSR has been contacted for investigation.

         REMAP
         -----
         REMAP allows a disk i/o device to be mapped to any DSK1...DSK9
         device number. Usage is as follows either in an AUTOEXEC file or
         at the MDOS Command Line prompt.

         Examples

         REMAP 1X       Maps DSK1 to TIPI DSK2 (assumes PI.CONFIG has entry)
         REMAP 4O       Maps DSK4 to a 16 bit HRD at CRU >1600


         DIR/ATTRIB/COPY
         ---------------
         The DIR, ATTRIB, and COPY commands have been modified in the event
         files are being copied or manipulated on the TIPI.  TI Specifications
         for the TI, Myarc, CorComp, SCSI, and IDE limit a maximum of 127 files
         and 114 directories at any filepath. With the use of the TIPI, the
         TIPI supports an unlimited number of files on the PI. As a result, if
         a TIPI path exceeds these limits when processing a command, not all
         files will be addressed by the command. MDOS will issue an alert
         indicating a file limitation was exceeded.

         MEM
         ---
         A new command, MEM, has been added to the command line interpreter.
         This command will display the total memory free for use for a program
         and the amount of identified Fast Ram based on current configurations.


FIXED COMMANDS / ROUTINES:
--------------------------

       o HFDC / Winchester Code:
         -----------------------
         Additional Winchester Code removed from the DSR routines.


       o SCSI, IDE, Horizon Ramdisk Code:
         --------------------------------
         The SCSI code has been expanded to provide support for the Horizon
         Ramdisk as a Ram Harddrive and the use of IDE drives with the Geneve
         9640. T. Tesch deserves a lot of credit for his work! A buffering
         bug present in a beta release of MDOS 6.70 impacting SCSI devices has
         been fixed.


       o IDE Specific notes
         ------------------
         The IDE controller card must be set at CRU >1900 for MDOS. To use
         the IDE drive requires V14 of Fred Kaal's DSR found at www.ti99-geek.nl
         The DSR must be installed using the Editor/Assembler cartridge in
         Rompage mode and the devices formatted prior to use.


       o TIPI Code:
         ----------
         The Geneve Master DSR has been expanded to include all of the TIPI
         device names including the DSKx, URIx, PI.xxx, and TIP1 replacing the
         TIPI device name.

         It is possible to print to PI.PIO, however older programs written that
         bypass the OPEN and CLOSE commands to the PIO port through a DSR will
         fail writing to PI.PIO. This is not a MDOS correctable issue.

         A TIPI XOP library (>0C) has been added to MDOS providing XOP support
         for accessing the TIPI. The MyTerm TIPI version uses this XOP as well
         as the internal TELNET command in the Command Line Interpreter. A
         separate file will be released detailing the specifications for
         using the XOP.

================================================================================

TIPI Support under MDOS 7.3 and later

Credit goes to T. Tesch for implementing MDOS support for the TIPI.  By far,
he is the GURU of the DSR's.

Most features of the TIPI have been developed.  Version MDOS 7.3 treats the
TIPI as device name TIP1.  DSK0 support has been added under GPL mode for
programs, however programs that require level 2 access will report an error.
Such programs include DM2K which will require ROMPAGE mode from the GPL
interpreter to be able to copy files to/from the TIPI if in GPL mode.

Rather than use Fred Kaal's DM2K program from GPL mode, Fred has recently
released a Geneve / MDOS version GDM2K.  This is the preferred method if
you want to have the most versatile disk management program. GDM2K also offers
the ability one can backup any device to a TIPI path by marking all files at
root level.  This will copy all directories and subdirectories.

The TIPI must be configured at CRU >1800 to be functional on the Geneve. In your
AUTOEXEC file, you must add a command to assign a drive letter to the TIPI as
such:

ASSIGN K=TIP1:    (K may be substituted for another drive letter up to drive P)

Development efforts are proceeding to have a new Geneve boot eprom to load MDOS
from the TIPI. Initial efforts were thought to be working but issues were found
requiring additional development time. It should be noted boot times will be
approximately 20 seconds from the TIPI when the issues are resolved.

Devices DSK0, DSK1, DSK2, DSK3, DSK4, TIP1, PI, URI1, URI2, and URI3 have been
implemented within the master DSR of the Geneve. Settings for DSK1, DSK2, DSK3,
and DSK4 must have their paths configured with TIPICFG from GPL mode, or
separately using a word processor and loading the file PI.CONFIG and updating.
This method is preferable, otherwise using TIPICFG requires using Rompage mode
due to the additional messaging protocols used by TIPICFG.

The PI.xxx routines such as PI.CONFIG, PI.PIO, PI.REBOOT, PI.SHUTDOWN, PI.STATUS
and others are accessible from MDOS mode.  Some of the commands when you attempt
to access will initiate an action with the PI.

Printing to PI.PIO is supported.  It should be noted several MDOS programs
including The Geometer's Apprentice, The Printer's Apprentice, and some versions
of Myart will not print.  This is because the original printing routines wrote
directly to the parallel port rather than using the DSR commands for OPEN, WRITE
and CLOSE.

With the URIx device names, it is possible to load and run programs from the
internet from the MDOS prompt.

Texas Instruments, and then Myarc with the Myarc HFDC following suit, placed
limits on file and directory storage on devices.  TI imposed a 127 file limit,
and Myarc added a limit of 114 directories in addition to the 127 file limit.
MDOS was written with these specifications. With the TIPI and the use of the
Raspberry PI, there is essentially no limit on the number of files in a
directory or a limit on the number of subdirectories. Thus, on a Raspberry PI,
it is possible a directory could have thousands of files.

MDOS can not handle such a large file or directory listing and will only show
the first 127 files and 114 directories at any path. If there are more files or
directories, the function including DIR, ATTRIB, COPY, etc. will report a limit
was reached for the command that was used to alert the user not all files were
seen or processed.

The REMAP command has been expanded to map TIPI device names of DSK1, DSK2,
DSK3, and DSK4 to the assignment letters of W, X, Y, and Z.

Example:

REMAP 1W  Maps TIPI DSK1 to DSK1
REMAP 1X  Maps TIPI DSK2 to DSK1
REMAP 1Y  Maps TIPI DSK3 to DSK1
REMAP 1Z  Maps TIPI DSK4 to DSK1
REMAP 2W  Maps TIPI DSK1 to DSK2
REMAP 3W  Maps TIPI DSK1 to DSK3
REMAP 4W  Maps TIPI DSK1 to DSK4
(etc)

There are several files from the TIPI/PI you can load from an editor such as
PI.STATUS and PI.CONFIG.  An example of a PI.STATUS file is shown below that
gives you information about the VERSION of the PI (2.20) and RELDATE of the DSR.


PI.STATUS
=========

MAC_ETH0=dc:a6:32:db:be:72
MAC_WLAN0=dc:a6:32:db:be:73
IP_WLAN0=192.168.1.79
VERSION=2.20
RELDATE=2021-02-24
UUID=404a4202-48b0-11eb-87dc-b827ebf07f81
LATEST=2.20


Shown below is the PI.CONFIG file that can be edited in MyWord and saved back as
a filename of PI.CONFIG. The DSK1_DIR through DSK4_DIR lines point to
directories on the PI that can subsequently be mapped to a DSK1 through DSK9
device with the REMAP command.  You should add the DIR_SORT=FIRST command to
your file if it does not already exist.  No entry will result in confusing
directory listings from the TIPI/PI. The TZ entry establishes a timezone for
New York (EST) for all time/date stamping of files. The URIx paths establish
a website/URL where programs may be loaded directly from the URL at the website.


PI.CONFIG
=========

AUTO=off
DIR_SORT=FIRST
DSK1_DIR=TPA
DSK2_DIR=MDOS
DSK3_DIR=TGA
DSK4_DIR=AFTER
MOUSE_SCALE=50
SECTOR_COUNT=9999
TIPI_NAME=TIPI#4
TZ=America/New_York
URI1=http://myti99.com
URI2=http://ftp.whtech.com/TIPI
URI3=http://ftp.whtech.com/TIPI
WIFI_PSK=xxxxxxxxx
WIFI_SSID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


As a reference, below is a copy of my AUTOEXEC file I use and notes to the side
to follow what the command does. As a reference, I have an 8MB HRD at CRU >1600,
a TIPI at CRU >1800, a RS232 card, a Myarc HFDC at CRU >1100 attached to a
DREM emulating two hard drives of 64 MB each, a SCSI card at CRU >1200 with a
SCSI2SD emulation drive configured with 7 x 256 MB drives.  I have no floppy
drives, and the TIPI is connected to a Raspberry PI 4 with 128 GB ram. For
memory expansion, I have a PFM+ and a MEMEX card with 504K ram.

Supporting Files
================

There are a number of other supporting programs recommended for this latest
release of MDOS.

Included in this distribution in subdirectories
-----------------------------------------------

Abasic
======
Abasic has been updated to V4.06 and is included in the complete MDOS package.
Updates may be found at www.9640News.com

GPL
===
GPL files are being included with this archive with the latest V7+ GPL
intrepreter. The updates with a GPL-README file are included in the GPL730
directory. There are two sets of GPL files in this directory.  One set is for
the 80 column menu screen.  The other set, is a revised TI-BASIC GPL ROM/GROM
set.

PFM and PFM+
============
The subdirectory PFM contains utilities that are required to reprogram the CORE
functionality of the PFM and PFM+ devices. The original PFM and PFM+ cores were
only able to embed MDOS into the flash eprom at 120K for the PFM+ and 128K in
PFM versions.  These utilities to reprogram the PFM must be run from the MDOS
command line.  Read the file, PFM-DOC, for instructions that must be followed
verbatim.

CRCOS7
======
CRCOS7 and docs are in the CRCOS7 directory. This program tests the integrity
of the MDOS SYSTEM/SYS file.  The CRC value for MDOS 7.30 is shown in the
beginning header of this file. If this value does not match, then you are using
a modified version and not the original released file.

EXEC27
======
EXEC originally written by Barry Boone has been updated as changes were needed
to properly handle the powerup routines for the new devices and to fix earlier
MDOS bugs.

GENCFG
======
GENCFG is a program written to format 16 bit Horizon Ramdisks and use
them either as a ramdisk or hard-ramdrive or as a combination.  GENCFG
will identify the hardware in your system and allow you set your ramdisk
as a bootable partition.

TEST
====
The TEST directory contains multiple variations of a program allowing the
loading of MDOS from various devices with AUTOEXEC boot tracking to the device.
