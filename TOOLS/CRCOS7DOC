=====================================================================

CRCOS is a command line program that is used to verify the integrity of
the Geneve OS/MDOS system file. It utilizes a table-driven CRC-16 routine
to enhance speed, reducing overall calculation times by 60-70% compared
with the earlier CRACK128 releases.

CRCOS7 is only for use with Geneve OS/MDOS Version 7.x variants.


USAGE:
=======
CRCOS7 is  run from the Geneve OS command line or batch file:

       Usage:  CRCOS7  <system file>

     Example:  CRCOS  H:\SYSTEM"/"SYS   quotes only needed for backslash
               CRCOS7 G:\SYSTEM-SYS

The program will load the entire OS into memory then calculate the CRC value
for each 8k segment. The calculated values will be compared to the embedded
CRCs.  Changes to the OS - intentional or otherwise - will result in a
mismatch.  CRCOS will either report that the OS is verified or that it has
been modified.

A 2-byte CRC reference value is provided to the user. This value can be used
to compare to the official release value. It can also be used as reference
should the user sector-edit their own copy and wish to know if it has
changed since that alteration.

The CRC injection program is currently restricted to OS Developers
