************
*  This routine will bank in RAM on the selected peripheral card.
*   RAM on the HFDC is located at addresses >9000->9FFF.
*        The bank at >9000-93FF is not selectable.
*        The remaining three banks (at >9400 to >97FF and >9800 to >9BFF )
*        plus ( >9C00-9FFF ) are selectable via CRU bits.  Only two of
*        the three RAM windows are really used.  On the HFDC, consecutive
*        banks are loaded into the first two memory windows.  These are then
*        used to hold file information.  Each window can picture 4 buffers.
*        So 8 buffers at a time are displayed, depending on the value of R5.
